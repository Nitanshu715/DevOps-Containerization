## About This Repository

This repository serves as the **master lab repository** for the subject  
**Containerization and DevOps**.

Each experiment is organized in its **own folder**, containing:
- Experiment-specific source files
- Individual README documentation
- Commands, configurations, and outputs
- Observations and results

This structure reflects **real-world DevOps repositories**, where infrastructure,
automation, and documentation coexist in a clean, scalable manner.

---

## Why This Repository Exists

Modern software systems require:
- Fast deployment
- Scalability
- Automation
- Reproducibility

This lab repository demonstrates **hands-on implementation** of:
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Virtualization vs Containerization
- Linux system administration
- Docker-based application deployment
- DevOps best practices

## 🧪 Experiments Performed

### 🖥️ [Experiment 1 — Virtual Machines vs Containers](https://github.com/Nitanshu715/DevOps-Containerization/tree/main/Experiment-1/README/md)

A DevOps-oriented comparison between Virtual Machines and Containers using Ubuntu, VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker, and Nginx. Demonstrates infrastructure provisioning, VM-based service deployment, containerized application execution, and architectural differences in resource usage and isolation.

---

### 🐳 [Experiment 2 — Docker Installation & Container Lifecycle](https://github.com/Nitanshu715/DevOps-Containerization/tree/main/Experiment-2/README.md)

Covers Docker fundamentals including image pulling, container execution with port mapping, service verification, port conflict handling, and full container lifecycle management — reflecting real-world container deployment workflows.
