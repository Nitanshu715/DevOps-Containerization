## 📌 About This Repository

This repository serves as the **master lab repository** for the subject  
**Containerization and DevOps**.

Each experiment is organized in its **own folder**, containing:
- Experiment-specific source files
- Individual README documentation
- Commands, configurations, and outputs
- Observations and results

This structure reflects **real-world DevOps repositories**, where infrastructure,
automation, and documentation coexist in a clean, scalable manner.

---

## 🧠 Why This Repository Exists

Modern software systems require:
- Fast deployment
- Scalability
- Automation
- Reproducibility

This lab repository demonstrates **hands-on implementation** of:
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Virtualization vs Containerization
- Linux system administration
- Docker-based application deployment
- DevOps best practices
